Dogs vs Cats Classification Project:

The Dogs vs Cats Classification project is a machine learning initiative aimed at classifying images of dogs and cats using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, constructing an efficient deep learning model, and providing a user-friendly pipeline for training and prediction. By leveraging data augmentation techniques like random flipping, rotation, and zoom, the model achieves robustness against variations in input images, improving its generalization capabilities.

The dataset is organized into training, validation, and testing subsets, ensuring a balanced evaluation of model performance. The CNN architecture includes multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification. With callbacks like early stopping and model checkpointing, training is optimized to prevent overfitting and to save the best-performing model automatically. TensorBoard integration allows real-time monitoring of training progress, providing insights into metrics such as accuracy and loss.

Users can predict the class of a new image by loading the trained model and providing the image file as input. The prediction pipeline preprocesses the image to match the model's input dimensions and outputs the classification along with a visual display. This project serves as a foundation for image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical implementation of CNNs and offering a flexible framework for extending to other datasets or use cases.
