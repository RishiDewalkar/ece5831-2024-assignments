This is 05-3 assignment of Pattern Recognition and neural networks:
This assignment provides a neural network-based solution for classifying handwritten digits using the popular MNIST dataset. The model, implemented in Python, leverages a simple three-layer neural network with pre-trained weights stored in a file. The network includes two hidden layers with sigmoid activation functions and an output layer with softmax activation, allowing it to accurately predict digit labels based on pixel data. The project is structured to load, preprocess, and test MNIST data for evaluating model performance. Additionally, it includes functionality for accuracy assessment, providing insight into the modelâ€™s effectiveness on unseen test data. This repository is ideal for anyone looking to understand the implementation of neural networks in Python or to explore digit classification using classic machine learning techniques.
