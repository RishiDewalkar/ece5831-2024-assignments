In this assignment, three different machine learning models are implemented using neural networks to solve classification problems on three distinct datasets. The Boston Housing Prediction model predicts the median value of homes in Boston based on various features using a simple feed-forward neural network. The IMDB Sentiment Classification model predicts the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews, while the Reuters News Classification model classifies news articles into one of 46 topics. Each script involves data preprocessing, model building with Keras, training the model, evaluating it on test data, and visualizing the performance with plots of training/validation loss and accuracy. The assignment demonstrates a practical application of neural networks to real-world datasets.
Regression - BostonHousing:
This script is designed to predict the median value of homes in Boston using a neural network model. It utilizes the Boston Housing dataset, which is preloaded from Keras, and applies k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance. The model is a simple feed-forward neural network consisting of two hidden layers, each with 64 neurons. The data is normalized, and the model is compiled using the RMSprop optimizer and MSE loss function. The script includes functions to train the model, evaluate it on test data, and plot the validation MAE over epochs.
Binary classification - IMDB:
This script implements a neural network for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie reviews dataset. The reviews are vectorized into binary matrices using one-hot encoding, and the model is a simple feed-forward neural network with two hidden layers. The network is trained on the training data and evaluated on test data to predict whether a review is positive or negative. The script includes functions to train the model, plot training and validation loss, and accuracy over epochs. It also visualizes the model's performance after training.
Multiclass Classification - Reuters:
This script classifies news articles into 46 different categories using the Reuters dataset. The data is preprocessed by one-hot encoding the words in the articles, and a simple feed-forward neural network model is built with two hidden layers. The model is trained using sparse categorical crossentropy loss and RMSprop optimization. The script includes functions for data preparation, model building, training, evaluation, and plotting training/validation loss and accuracy. It also evaluates the model's performance on test data and outputs the final loss and accuracy values.
